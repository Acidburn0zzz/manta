# Image conversion

This job takes any number of image objects as input (e.g., PNG images) and
converts them to "gif" format using the ImageMagick "convert" tool, storing the
converted image in the same directory as the input object.  This example runs on
a set of icons in the public domain from the [Open Icon
Library](http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/).
