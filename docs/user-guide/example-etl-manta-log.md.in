# ETL example using Manta access logs

This example demonstrates a simple ETL (extract, transform, load) workflow that
reads an arbitrary number of Manta HTTP access logs (which you can find under
your own user at `~~/reports/access-logs`) and emits a SQL dump file
suitable for importing into Postgres and running queries on.

This workflow is useful when the source dataset (the access logs) is too large
to support interactive queries using traditional tools, but it's possible to
create a smaller database that summarizes the fields that users want to query.
These interactive queries can be run on the database, and they execute faster
than similar queries on the raw data.  The database itself is effectively
transient: as the underlying dataset grows, or the real-time query requirements
change to require additional information to be stored in the database, you can
tweak the database generation job, throw out the old database, and generate a
new one.

In this way, Manta can remain the repository of record for the raw data, support
complex jobs over the raw data, and also support fast interactive queries on an
optimized database that summarizes the raw data.

## Using the database

**Once you've run the job (see "Run it yourself" below)**, you can import the
output SQL file into any postgres instance.  You can even load it into an
interactive "mlogin" job:

    $ mlogin $(mjob outputs $JOBID)
     * created interactive job -- 66e017ee-8efb-4ecb-8c65-6c08ddfed5b8
     * waiting for session... / established

This next step configures security to allow all connections over a local
connection with no password.  (This is normally a bad idea, but in this case,
we're running the database in an isolated environment, so there's no threat):

    dap@manta # echo "local all all trust" > /var/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

We have to do the rest as a non-root user:

    dap@manta # su postgres

Now we start Postgres:

    dap@manta # pg_ctl start -D /var/pgsql/data
    server starting
    dap@manta # LOG:  database system was shut down at 2013-05-03 09:52:20 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

load our database:

    dap@manta # psql < $MANTA_INPUT_FILE > /dev/null

and run an interactive query:

    dap@manta # psql
    psql (9.1.9)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# SELECT method,count(*) FROM AllRequests GROUP BY method ORDER BY count DESC;
     method | count
    --------+-------
     PUT    |   371
     GET    |   213
     DELETE |   132
     POST   |     9
     HEAD   |     9
    (5 rows)

    postgres=#
