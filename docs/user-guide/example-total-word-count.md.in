# Total word count

This job takes any number of plain text objects (e.g., mailbox files or source
code) and computes the total number of characters, words, and lines in all of
the objects, much like the "wc" Unix command.

The job has two phases: the first phase (a map phase) processes the inputs in
parallel, and the second phase (a reduce phase) adds the results together to
produce a single output.
