# Video transcoding

This job takes any number of video objects as input and uses the "ffmpeg" tool
to transcode each one into the "webm" format.  It stores the converted video
under your user account's public directory, using a name similar to the input
video.  This example runs on a video from the public
[kartlytics](http://www.joyent.com/blog/introducing-kartlytics-mario-kart-64-analytics)
dataset.

Note that this example uses ffmpeg's `-nostdin` option to avoid attempting to
read user input from stdin.  If this flag is left out, ffmpeg attempts to
interpret the video file itself (which Manta provides on stdin) as an
interactive interface through which it accepts commands like "q" to exit.  The
result is that video files are often truncated.  Use the "-nostdin" ffmpeg
option to avoid this behavior.  For more information, see
[ffmpeg ticket 42](http://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/42).
