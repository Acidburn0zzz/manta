# Line count by file extension

This job takes an arbitrary number of text files as input and produces a report
summarizing the most common file types (based on file extension, like ".txt",
or ".js") and how many files and lines were found for each file type.  This
example runs over the files in the Node.js v0.10.17 source tree.

This example demonstrates using the `$MANTA_INPUT_OBJECT` environment variable
to refer to the name of the object, and uses bash features to extract just the
file extension.

## Run it yourself

Once you've set up the [Manta CLI
tools](http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/#getting-started), you can run this job
yourself on the publicly accessible dataset using the following command:

EOF


# Inline the job.sh
awk '{ printf("    "); } NR == 1 { printf("$ "); } { print $0 };' job.sh


cat <<'EOF'

which outputs:

EOF

awk '{ printf("    %s\n", $0); }' job.err
awk '{ printf("    %s\n", $0); }' job.out
