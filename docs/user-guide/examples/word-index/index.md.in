# Word index

This job takes an arbitrary number of plaintext objects as input and produces a
plaintext index file that lists the files and line numbers where each word
appears in the whole corpus.  This example runs on a corpus of Shakespeare's
written works.

This example uses a couple of
[assets](http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/jobs-reference.html#assets-assets-property)
(external scripts that are used in running the job).  The first is indexone.sh,
which indexes a single object:

EOF


awk '{ printf("    %s\n", $0); }' indexone.sh


cat <<'EOF'

The second is indexmerge.awk, which is used to merge the per-object indexes:

EOF


awk '{ printf("    %s\n", $0); }' indexmerge.awk


cat <<'EOF'

## Run it yourself

Once you've set up the [Manta CLI
tools](http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/#getting-started), you can run this job
yourself on the publicly accessible dataset using the following command:

EOF


# Inline the job.sh
awk '{ printf("    "); } NR == 1 { printf("$ "); } { print $0 };' job.sh


cat <<'EOF'

Because the output for this job is quite large, this example did not use
"mjob create -o" (which prints all job outputs). For the actual output, see
"Output summary" below.
EOF
