# Image conversion

This job takes any number of image objects as input (e.g., PNG images) and
converts them to "gif" format using the ImageMagick "convert" tool, storing the
converted image in the same directory as the input object.  This example runs on
a set of icons in the public domain from the [Open Icon
Library](http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/).

## Run it yourself

Once you've set up the [Manta CLI
tools](http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/#getting-started), you can run this job
yourself on the publicly accessible dataset using the following command:

EOF


# Inline the job.sh
awk '{ printf("    "); } NR == 1 { printf("$ "); } { print $0 };' job.sh


cat <<'EOF'

Because the output for this job is quite large, this example did not use
"mjob create -o" (which prints all job outputs). For the actual output, see
"Output summary" below.
EOF
